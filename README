Simple, portable, auditable, secure password generator.

Requires a standard C compiler and a source of randomness, like /dev/random

Program works by reading input stream and writing any printable characters 
until the desired length is reached.

For environments that need less password complexity, you may prefer to use
'isalphanum()' instead of 'isprint()'.

USAGE

./password
